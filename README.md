## Effect of Marine Microalgae on the growth of Sea Urchins *Paracentrotus Lividus*
### *Sea Urchins holds the future :*

* Sea urchins are a crucial aquatic economic organism which have been widely use the modal system for studying gene regulation and biomineralization and have a crucial role in marine ecosystems.In many nations, sea urchins are a significant aquatic economic creature due to their high food value and vital role in the marine ecosystem. On the other hand, it has recently been overfished to the point of near extinction, and its continued existence is crucial for the long-term viability of sea urchin farming. Sea urchins are vulnerable to dying while still in their larval state. In order to determine whether different types of microalgae can increase sea urchins' rates of development and survival, two types of microalgae were employed as the initial food source in this study.I am using the P Different concentrations of *Phaeodactylum* and *Dunaliella salina* are fed to P. Lividus and their growth are documented. My research should reveal molecular mechanisms essential to the development of the sea urchin's body and other metabolic processes. Understanding the food that they eat and its potential impacts will aid in our comprehension of P. Lividus' feeding habits. With the use of this data, we can support the recovery efforts of sea urchin aquaculturists and further assist in mitigating the harm caused by climate change to their native Mediterranean and Israeli coasts. It will facilitate and ease the numerous research labs' and institutes' access to this modal organism supply. Long-term, it may contribute to maintaining the equilibrium of the marine ecosystem along Israel's coast.

The life cycle of sea urchins is compraised of two parts :- Planktonic Larval Phase and Adult benthic phase.

The experiment has just been started and I have got the following outcomes :-   

**(d)** The experiment schedules and their outcome till now :-
